>About me</h2>
<div class="cards1 gap3">
<section>
<h3 class="fs3 fwn">Web development</h3>
<p>
In July 2024 I interned full time
<a href="https://helvia.ai/">
at Helvia</a>,
one month on DevOps/operations and for two months
I learned NextJS, MongoDB and Python's FastAPI by
<a href="https://theodoros-d-alenas.site/key-mouth/"
>making Key Mouth</a>.
It's a chat app that shows each key instead of messages.
It was hard mainly because there's no point of reference to hold onto.
</p>
<p>
Before joining Helvia, we had cources related to web development and
I tried PostGres SQL, MySQL and MongoDB,
I read some code in VueJS and Python's Jango and
I tried learning Spring in Java and Kotlin a few times.
I entered a few Docker containers in my free time to look around
and I played around with Jest and Typescript.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="fs3 fwn">Linux</h3>
<p>
I tried WSL in 2020, I believe,
then I went to Linux Mint and then,
because I couldn't figure out how to use minimal tools on Mint,
I installed Arch Linux with the manual installation.
I was 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DistroTube"
>motivated mostly by the DistroTube channel</a>
on YouTube
but I'm not into that mindset anymore.
</p>
<p>
I used the shell a lot and eventually I got good at
the POSIX subset, both for scripts and on the command line interactively.
One day I rented an Alpine Linux server
for backups and to use it to serve this site with NginX and certbot.
It's alright, though I wouldn't say I'm good at serving sites.
There's downtime sometimes and
the certificates are a little off,
but there's been progress.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3 class="fs3 fwn">Social experiences</h3>
<p>
I was a stereotypical programmer up to about 2021,
today I do have a few friends.
</p>
<p>
In University projects
I gave emphasis on UX user tests,
I showed some teammates how we could do automated tests
and in two projects I demonstrated some draft prototypes.
None of this went well though and that's a topic that
I can talk about all day.
My favorite project was a simple research on the Rust compiler
with 3 firends where we were face to face
2 months, 4 hours a day, 4 days a week at least.
</p>
</section>
</div>

<h3 class="fs3 fwn">
<a href="r/cv-2024-10-10.pdf"
>CV as PDF</a>
</h3>
<p>
The CV complements this site.
It emphasizes the parts that are more measurable.
</p>


<h2 class="fs5 fwn mt4">Most educational projects</h2>
<p>
The project that taught me the most, by far, is
<a href="https://theodoros-d-alenas.site/key-mouth/"
>the Key Mouth web app</a>.
I won't go into details here though because there are
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/key-mouth"
>details on the GitHub page</a>.
The most valuable lessons for me were rewritten projects
and ideas that I had to throw away, so that's what I'd like to focus on.
</p>
<h3 class="fs4 fwn bdb2 mt3">The 2 rewrites of this site</h3>
<p>
The site used to have a typical menu at the top.
</p>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Identity buffee</h4>
<p>
Abstract PHP functions that compose HTML code.
It's still <a href="old-versions/13-before-abandoning/en/index.html"
>served</a> and it's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/personal-website-1/"
>GitHub</a>.
</p>
<pre class="code1"><code>include_once(&quot;common/wraps/<b>typical-layouts</b>.php&quot;);
[...]
function <b>get_biography_html</b>(string $language) &lbrace;
  return <b>get_typical_layout</b>&lpar;
    $language,</code></pre>

<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Fewest layers possible</h4>
<p>
Abstractions got replaced with abbreviations.
I serve an
<a href="old-versions/20-hamburger-menu/en/index.html"
>older</a> and a
<a href="old-versions/21-blue-mountains-many-themes/en/index.html"
>newer</a> version
and it's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/personal-website-2/"
>GitHub</a>.
</p>
<pre class="code1"><code>&lt;?php $STR_XML = <b>simplexml_load_file</b>(&quot;biography/bio-high-school.xml&quot;) ?&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;?php $b(&quot;<b>title</b>&quot;) ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;?php $b(&quot;<b>graduated</b>&quot;) ?&gt;

    &gt;&lt;?php $b(&quot;<b>high_school</b>&quot;) ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Least text possible</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://www.kevinpowell.co/">Kevin Powell's site</a>
inspired me to reduce the text,
to the point that I could serve hand written HTML.
</p>
<pre class="code1"><code><b>&lt;h4 class=&quot;fs3 fwn&quot;&gt;</b>Fewest layers possible<b>&lt;/h4&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
Abstractions got replaced with abbreviations.
I serve an
<b>&lt;a href=&quot;old-versions/20-hamburger-menu/en/index.html&quot;
&gt;</b>older<b>&lt;/a&gt;</b> and a</code></pre>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Conclusion</h4>
<p>
At first it looks like I lowered the requirements to get away with draft code
but I'd say the requirements overall went up.
It was a requirement to be laconic,
one could say there was a requirement to
make the browser tools reflect the source code better,
and it's fun to hand write HTML with no indentation.
</p>
<h3 class="fs4 fwn bdb2 mt3">The 3 rewrites of my hotkey system</h4>
<p>
I use an odd operating system which relies on key combinations
becuase there's no taskbar or bars on windows.
I had one real option, to use
<a href="https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd"><code>sxhkd</code></a>,
but I wanted a pop-up guide too like
<a href="https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim"><code>which-key</code></a>
and I couldn't have one.
</p>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Prompt for next key</h4>
<p>
3 bash scripts and the language shown below.
A terminal appeared to list keys and take input.
</p>
<pre class="code1"><code><b>s *screenshot</b>   sel=$(slop -f &quot;-i %i -g %g&quot;); shotgun $sel /tmp/screenshot.png
<b>S *scrsh-fulls</b>  sleep 0; shotgun /tmp/screenshot.png</code></pre>
<p>
The terminal messed with the notion of previous window
and the hotkeys for switching windows had bugs.
</p>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Hotkey shell commands</h4>
<p>
A new demand was that
Win + e, Win + Alt + r
should also be possible from the terminal as
<code>al e +r</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another new demand is that Win + m, Win + v
is bound to <code>pacmd set-sink-volume 0 ...</code>
and I'll be prompted to fill in the gap.
It's uploaded on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/hotkey-system-2-alk"
>GitHub</a> after the fact.
</p>
<pre class="code1"><code><b>video | V)</b> mpv_shut_up $(find ~/img/go -name '*.mp4' | shuf) <b>;;</b>
<b>screenshot | s)</b> sxiv /tmp/screenshot.png <b>;;</b></code></pre>
<p>
The configuration code was verbose
and the commands couldn't be listed reliably.
It wasn't actually used it in the terminal either.
</p>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Code snippet composer</h4>
<p>
The demands went up
but they weren't based on real needs.
It's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/alsnip/blob/main/example-config/reset.sh"
>GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
There had to be a list of text snippets,
some of which are operating system commands,
some of which are bound to hotkeys.
Some can prompt for completion.
The completion gives hints,
a bar shows the final command that ran,
and each text snippet has an easily accessible description.
Other purposes for the text snippets were shell aliases,
copying ASCII art and
completing parts of a C for loop and copying it.
Below is part of the list that appeared on the screen.
</p>
<pre class="code1"><code>vol1  .m1 /auto   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 6000
vol0  .m0 /auto   | pacmd set-sink-volume 0 0
wm_t7 .!7 /auto   | bspc node --to-desktop temporary --follow
wm_b7 .^7 /auto   | bspc node @temporary:/ --to-desktop focused</code></pre>
<p>
The configuration was shell scripts that printed shell scripts.
It became so slow that I considered caching.
</p>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Self-installing shell script</h4>
<pre class="code1"><code><b>about_logging</b>() { <b>tail /tmp/scmd.sh</b>; echo &quot;Should have lines that look like: <b>func() { echo hi; } #>>hi</b>&quot;; }
<b>about_why</b>() { echo &quot;<b>For the syntax highlighting and to reduce bugs</b>. I've made many abstract hotkey systems.&quot;; }
  [...]
<b>volume_set_8</b>() { pacmd set-sink-volume 0 48000; } <b>#m8</b>
<b>volume_set_9</b>() { pacmd set-sink-volume 0 54000; } <b>#m9</b>
<b>volume_set_custom</b>() { pacmd set-sink-volume 0 &quot;$(:|dmenu)&quot;; }
  [...]
<b>scmd_run</b>() &lbrace; c=&quot;$(dmenu &lt; &quot;$(<b>this_file</b>)&quot; | cut -d&#039;(&#039; -f1)&quot;; test &quot;$c&quot; &amp;&amp; <b>scmd_with_bar_status</b> &quot;$c&quot;; &rbrace; <b>#x</b>
  [...]
<b>this_file</b>() { echo ~/.config/scmd.sh; }</code></pre>
<p>
I got syntax highlighting in my configuration file,
I got a listing, a superset of the hotkey commands,
a bar saying what ran,
I could run the same actions from the terminal
and for the first time I could easily log the commands and their output.
</p>
<p>
It's on
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/dotfiles/blob/main/scmd.sh"
>GitHub</a>
among my dotfiles.
</p>
<h4 class="fs3 fwn">Conclusion</h4>
<p>
This project made me think of code as a person going through phases.
It started relatable, then it became fancy and then almost grumpy.
Just like the website, I ended up with one file with flat hierarchies.
Maybe at scale a project can't go through phases in the same way
but I find this phenomenon to be fascinating.
</p>
<h3 class="fs4 fwn bdb2 mt3">Other experiments at home</h4>
<p>
Some other stories are
the directory structure of my laptop
which was restructured 4 times alongside its remote backup,
the image tagging facilities which used python GUIs at first,
I was trying to decorate my operating system for some time,
I tried to &quot;clean-up&quot; the
<a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/"><code>dmenu</code></a>
project but I had to accept I made it worse and I re-wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/"
>clock pop-up</a>
from Python to C and it ended up uglier.
</p>
<h3 class="fs4 fwn mt3">Thanks for reading</h3>

Have a nice day, don't hesitate to hit me up!
